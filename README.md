# MCDEX DAO

The MCDEX community has issued its governance token MCB and has done a series of governance work. While launching the Mai3 protocol, we will establish MCDEX DAO based on MCB. MCDEX DAO will be the core of the MCDEX community. The mission of MCDAO is to continuously develop the MCDEX ecosystem.
